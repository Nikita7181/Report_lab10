  - Add installer for oracle. Thanks @TobyHFerguson for [GH-145]
  - Add redhat installer support for centos7. Thanks @roidelapluie for [GH-162]
  - Add debian installer support for debian8. Thanks @ubermuda for [GH-171]
  - Add ISO auto-detection on Archlinux hosts. [GH-135]

  - And systemd-ish startup methods if available, instead of assuming `/etc/init.d/vboxadd` being useable.
  - Add configuration options for iso upload path and mount point.
  - Add a `--no-cleanup` command-line switch to make debugging a bit more convenient.

## 0.10.1 (2015-10-08)

  - Make sure our log message strings are loaded [GH-107]

    Customize arguments passed to the VirtualBox GuestAdditions shell script
    installer. Defaults to "--no-x11". [GH-98]
  - Cope with UbuntuCloudImage by default [GH-86], [GH-64], [GH-43]
    On Ubuntu, always try to remove conflicting installations of
    GuestAdditions by removing those packages:
    virtualbox-guest-dkms virtualbox-guest-utils virtualbox-guest-x11
  - Unload kernel modules when UbuntuCloudImage packages are installed.
    (Thanks @eric1234 for commenting on ec9a7b1f0a)
  - Wait for SSH connection to be ready. Fixes timing issues with vagrant
    v1.3.0 and later. [GH-80], [GH-90]

    - remove version locks on gems provided by vagrant
  - Pass plugin name when registration the action hook for vagrant ≥1.1 [GH-80]
  - Fix crash on Vagrant 1.4 [GH-100]

### heads-up
  
  - With [GH-94] the **name**, `vagrant-vbguest` registers itself to vagrant's
    (≥1.1) plugin-system changed from 'vbguest management' to
    'vagrant-vbguest'

## 0.9.0

  - Adds support for vagrant 1.3 [GH-71], [GH-72]
  - Fix crash when using as a command [GH-68].
  - Don't trust VirtualBox Media Manager informations when
    looking for an iso file. [GH-70]

### heads-up

  - Be lax about missing installer for guest OS.
    No longer throws an error when no Installer class
    for the guest os was found. Keep the error message,
    stop vbguest workflow, but keep vagrant running.
    [GH-65]


## 0.8.0

  - Adds Vagrant 1.2 compatibility [GH-59], [GH-60], [GH-62] /
    (thanks @Andrew8xx8 for pointing directions)
  - Fix basic/fallback linux installer [GH-56]
  - Guard auto-reload on broken vagrant builds.
    Some vagrant 1.1.x versions have a bug regarding ssh and cleaning
    up old connections, which results in vagrant crashing when a box
    is reloaded.

## 0.7.1

  - Fix auto-reloading for vagrant 1.1 [GH-52]
    Also changes the reload method for vagrant 1.0 when ran
    as middleware (to not run build-in actions manually).

## 0.7.0

  - When looking for a GuestAdditions iso file in media manager
    allow version number in filename. [GH-48], [GH-49] /
    (thanks @neerolyte)
  - Support multiple locations to be searched while "guessing"
    GuestAdditions iso file
  - On Linux guests also search "$HOME/.VirtualBox" for
    GuestAdditions iso file. [GH-48]
  - Add support for redhat-based distributions (Scientific Linux and
    presumably CentOS) [GH-47], [GH-46] / (thanks @neerolyte)
  - Fix an issue with VirtualBox GuestAdditions 4.2.8 [GH-44] /
    (thanks @jimmycuadra)
  - Reworked bunch of internals, particularly how vagrants's
    environment is passed around. Also decoupled GuestAdditions
    finder into a separate class.
  - Introduce a vagrant 1.0 compatibility layer for Installers and
    other vbguest internals

### heads-up

  - [GH-44] changes the behaviour of vbguest to that effect, that it
    will no longer halt vagrant workflow if running the VirtualBox
    GuestAdditions Installer returns an error-code.
    Instead it will print a human readable waring message.
  - The environment (`env`) in custom installers is no longer the
    actions environment `Hash`, but the `Environment` instance.
    Which has some implications on how you can access e.g. the `ui`:
    instead of `env[:ui]` use `env.ui`
  - To achieve compatibility to both vagrant 1.0 and 1.1, custom
    Installers, when executing shell commands on the guest system,
    should use vbguests `communicate` wrapper. e.g.:
        A call like `vm.channel.sudo 'apt-get update'` should be
        changed to `communicate.sudo 'apt-get update'`
    The old `vm.channel` syntax will continue to work on vagrant 1.0.x
    but will fail on vagrant 1.1.x.

   (old `$VBOX_VERSION` placeholder still working)
 - Revisited command arguments to not just mirror config values:
   - New `--do` argument: force-run one of those commands:
     * `start`   : Try to start the GuestAdditions Service
     * `rebuild` : Rebuild the currently installed Guest Additions
     * `install` : Run the installation process from "iso file"
   - New `--status` argument
